# Ethereum CUDA Miner


### Docker container for Ethereum mining with CUDA.

Simple and easy to run, if you have a Nvidia GPU and want to mine eth.
This is based off the Genoil ethminer branch #110 with NVIDIA CUDA v8.0 and should be compatible with NVIDIA 1080 and 1070.

**Note** This image builds the Genoil ethminer, which is faster than the standard opencl ethminer. [https://github.com/Genoil/cpp-ethereum](https://github.com/Genoil/cpp-ethereum)

### Requirements
- Nvidia drivers for your GPU, you can get them here: [Nvidia drivers](http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)
- nvidia-docker (so docker can access your GPU) install instructions here: [nvidia-docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker)

### How to run
```
nvidia-docker run -it anthonytatowicz/eth-cuda-miner ARG1 ARG2 ...

# Example
nvidia-docker run -it anthonytatowicz/eth-cuda-miner \
-S us-west1.nanopool.org:9999 \
-O 0x20ad58fe023265577565c7eb44b55c31e7497c33.cSquared/ajtatowicz@gmail.com
```

**Note** --farm-recheck, and -U are set by default

Usage ethminer [OPTIONS]
Options:

Work farming mode:
    -F,--farm <url>  Put into mining farm mode with the work server at URL (default: http://127.0.0.1:8545)
    -FF,-FO, --farm-failover, --stratum-failover <url> Failover getwork/stratum URL (default: disabled)
	--farm-retries <n> Number of retries until switch to failover (default: 3)
	-S, --stratum <host:port>  Put into stratum mode with the stratum server at host:port
	-FS, --failover-stratum <host:port>  Failover stratum server at host:port
    -O, --userpass <username.workername:password> Stratum login credentials
    -FO, --failover-userpass <username.workername:password> Failover stratum login credentials (optional, will use normal credentials when omitted)
    --work-timeout <n> reconnect/failover after n seconds of working on the same (stratum) job. Defaults to 60. Don't set lower than max. avg. block time
    --farm-recheck <n>  Leave n ms between checks for changed work (default: 500). When using stratum, use a high value (i.e. 2000) to get more stable hashrate output
    --no-precompute  Don't precompute the next epoch's DAG.
Ethash verify mode:
    -w,--check-pow <headerHash> <seedHash> <difficulty> <nonce>  Check PoW credentials for validity.

Benchmarking mode:
    -M [<n>],--benchmark [<n>] Benchmark for mining and exit; Optionally specify block number to benchmark against specific DAG.
    --benchmark-warmup <seconds>  Set the duration of warmup for the benchmark tests (default: 3).
    --benchmark-trial <seconds>  Set the duration for each trial for the benchmark tests (default: 3).
    --benchmark-trials <n>  Set the duration of warmup for the benchmark tests (default: 5).
Simulation mode:
    -Z [<n>],--simulation [<n>] Mining test mode. Used to validate kernel optimizations. Optionally specify block number.
    --phone-home <on/off>  When benchmarking, publish results (default: off)
DAG file management:
    -D,--create-dag <number>  Create the DAG in preparation for mining on given block and exit.
    -R <s>, --dag-dir <s> Store/Load DAG files in/from the specified directory. Useful for running multiple instances with different configurations.
    -E <mode>, --erase-dags <mode> Erase unneeded DAG files. Default is 'none'. Possible values are:
        none  - don't erase DAG files (default)
        old   - erase all DAG files older than current epoch
		bench - like old, but keep epoch 0 for benchmarking
        all   - erase all DAG files. After deleting all files, setting changes to none.
Mining configuration:
    -C,--cpu  When mining, use the CPU.
    -G,--opencl  When mining use the GPU via OpenCL.
    -U,--cuda  When mining use the GPU via CUDA.
    --opencl-platform <n>  When mining using -G/--opencl use OpenCL platform n (default: 0).
    --opencl-device <n>  When mining using -G/--opencl use OpenCL device n (default: 0).
    --opencl-devices <0 1 ..n> Select which OpenCL devices to mine on. Default is to use all
    -t, --mining-threads <n> Limit number of CPU/GPU miners to n (default: use everything available on selected platform)
    --allow-opencl-cpu Allows CPU to be considered as an OpenCL device if the OpenCL platform supports it.
    --list-devices List the detected OpenCL/CUDA devices and exit. Should be combined with -G or -U flag
    --current-block Let the miner know the current block number at configuration time. Will help determine DAG size and required GPU memory.
    --cl-extragpu-mem Set the memory (in MB) you believe your GPU requires for stuff other than mining. default: 0
    --cl-local-work Set the OpenCL local work size. Default is 64
    --cl-global-work Set the OpenCL global work size as a multiple of the local work size. Default is 4096 * 64
    --cuda-extragpu-mem Set the memory (in MB) you believe your GPU requires for stuff other than mining. Windows rendering e.t.c..
    --cuda-block-size Set the CUDA block work size. Default is 128
    --cuda-grid-size Set the CUDA grid size. Default is 8192
    --cuda-streams Set the number of CUDA streams. Default is 2
    --cuda-schedule <mode> Set the schedule mode for CUDA threads waiting for CUDA devices to finish work. Default is 'sync'. Possible values are:
        auto  - Uses a heuristic based on the number of active CUDA contexts in the process C and the number of logical processors in the system P. If C > P, then yield else spin.
        spin  - Instruct CUDA to actively spin when waiting for results from the device.
        yield - Instruct CUDA to yield its thread when waiting for results from the device.
        sync  - Instruct CUDA to block the CPU thread on a synchronization primitive when waiting for the results from the device.
    --cuda-devices <0 1 ..n> Select which CUDA GPUs to mine on. Default is to use all
General Options:
    -v,--verbosity <0 - 9>  Set the log verbosity from 0 to 9 (default: 8).
    -V,--version  Show the version and exit.
    -h,--help  Show this help message and exit.
